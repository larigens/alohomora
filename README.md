## Installation

If you would like to understand more about the code behind the app and edit it:

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

## Usage

First, the user needs to click on the red button to generate a password, and then a series of prompts will appear so that the desired type of criteria is selected.

1. Desired length of the password (From 8 to 128 characters),
2. If the user would like to include lowercase letters,
3. If the user would like to include uppercase letters,
4. If the user would like to include numeric characters,
5. If the user would like to include special characters.
   
> **The user MUST select at least one of the criteria, or an alert will be displayed.**

If the user enters a valid length and selects at least one of the criteria, the password is then generated and displayed within the textarea.
